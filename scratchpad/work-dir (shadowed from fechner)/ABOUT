This is the working directory for running info-flow Pipeline
simulations on fechner.

The script "run_matlab.sh" can be used either to initiate a batch job
in background or interactively in foreground.  In either instance, the
present directory becomes the "current" directory, and the matlabpath
is set to use the "iflow" version of matlab_lib (along with its
scratchpad subdirectory) rather than the default matlab_lib.  At
present, the "iflow" matlabpath also differs from the standard one in
omitting such tools as FSL and SPM (not necessarily a complete list).

On fechner this directory is a *sibling* of the iflow version of
matlab_lib.  It is also a sibling of data_store.  Therefore, when
MATLAB is run with the present directory as the "current" directory,
paths starting with "../data_store/" should resolve correctly.

The conventions followed by the batch scripts in this directory have
evolved somewhat over time, which is why some (but not all) of the
earlier scripts explicitly invoked "set_iflow_path" (now called
"reset_iflow_path").  That invocation is no longer necessary, because
"startup.m" now takes care of setting the path.
